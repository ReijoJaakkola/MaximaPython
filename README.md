# MaximaPython

This repository started as an attempt for creating a python API for maxima. However since I do not have sufficient skills in writing lisp, I was satisfied with being able to run the bat-script that calls maxima using python. After that I have mainly used this for creating automated tests for my other repo STACK-MAXIMA-FO.
